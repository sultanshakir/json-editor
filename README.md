# JSON Editor

Based on Thomas Frank's [jsoneditor](http://www.thomasfrank.se/json_editor.html).

## Added Scrolling Functionality

Added scrolling functionality so that if you have a large JSON dataset you won't have to scroll back up on the page to see or edit the form.  It will "follow" you as you scroll the page vertically.  Uses jQuery plugin - jQuery Scroll Follow (http://kitchen.net-perspective.com/open-source/scroll-follow/).
